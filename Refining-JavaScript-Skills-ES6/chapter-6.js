1. - Any value in JavaScript that is not a string, a number, a Symbol, or true, false, null, or undefined is an object.
2. - Object.prototype is one of the rare objects that has no prototype in that it does not inherit any properties.
3. - You can pass null to create a new object that does not have a prototype, but if you do this, the newly created
object will not inherit anything, not even basic methods like toString()
4. - One use for Object.create() is when you want to guard against unintended (but non-malicious) modification of an
object by a library function that you donâ€™t have control over.
